# Arabic Text Classification based on Machine learning Deep Learning Algorithms
In arabic text classification, texts have to be transformed into numeric representations suitable for the learning algorithms. in this studies, we used TF-IDF with Machine learning algorithms and Embedding words with Deep learnings. In the present study, text classification is comparative study based on a Machine learning methods and Deep learning Methods.  The current work has proved the ability to classify collections of Arabic or English text documents successfully. It showed approximately 98% sav- ings in vector space and 2% performance improvement compared to the best recorded results on Arabic dataset Aljazeera News.


# Dataset
Aljazeera news 5 classes dataset (Alj-News5). Alj-News5 is another different dataset that contains 1500 documents for news articles. Each document is labeled with one of the following five classes {‘Art’, ‘Economic’, ‘Politics’, ‘Science’, and ‘Sport’}. Alj-News5 was used by other researchers . A comparison of classification results of the current approach against other research works on Alj-News5 will be pre- sented in the experiments.
